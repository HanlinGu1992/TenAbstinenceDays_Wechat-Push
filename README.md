# Ten Abstinence Days - Wechat Push 十斋日微信测试号每日推送

This project aims to implement an automated WeChat notification system that delivers daily reminders at 08:00 during ten specific lunar calendar days (1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th) for spiritual practice observance. The notification serves as a prompt for users to engage in the recitation of "The Sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva" as part of their religious discipline.
本项目是在每月的十斋日，也就是阴历的初一、八、十四、十五、十八、二十三、二十四、二十八、二十九、三十，已提醒诵读地藏经。
